                Hi, Iâ€™m Ollie. I have been coding since I was a young teen
                working on indie games. I got into front-end development after
                teaching myself post-high school, while also training at
                the climbing gym that I then worked at. Since then, I have
                improved my craft through professional experience and have been
                fortunate enough to improve finer details of my Front-End
                ability by spending some time working as an SEO Analyst. I currently work and
                train out of Prescott, Arizona.
